# Linear-Algebra-Done-Right_Solution-Manual

This is my solution manual for the texbook *Linear Algebra Done Right*, 4th edition by Sheldon Axler.
Solution is written by Latex and VScode, open to all people learning this book.

I just write down some of the after-book exercises.
Also there are some problems copied from the 3rd edtion of the book.
See the solution manual on https://linearalgebras.com/ (I don't know who make the website, and thank you!).

Some solutions in my solution manual is copied from the website mentioned above, I think I must point this out.

If there are some mistakes, send me an email to of_tangcy@stu.pku.edu.cn

The Latex template was downloaded from [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).
